# Onboarding lab base agent

Creates the base Azure SRE Agent used by `labs/onboardinglab`:

- Review mode with Low access
- Agent deployment into the resource group created by the onboarding workload
- Read-only managed-resource access to that same resource group
- Checkout Application Insights connector
- Azure Monitor incident platform
- Attendee-owned `ticketingapp-source` GitHub repository containing the complete ticketing app azd project
- `onboardinglab-architecture.md` and `onboardinglab-incident-runbook.md` knowledge sources
- Office 365 Outlook managed connector with runtime access and interactive OAuth consent
- `onboardinglab-safety` common prompt
- Global tool policy with agent and notification writes set to ask for approval
- Guarded `sre-agent-self-configure` administrative skill

Files under `data/` are uploaded automatically as Knowledge Sources by the shared deployer. Users do not need to upload them manually in the portal.

The self-configuration skill can inspect and generate agent configuration. Its Azure CLI write tool remains governed by Review mode and limits changes to the current agent. Workflow investigation skills, the `alert-investigator` custom agent and its evidence-checklist Stop hook, response plans, and scheduled tasks are installed separately from the onboarding lab workflow template.
