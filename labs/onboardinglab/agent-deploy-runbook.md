# Onboarding Lab - agent deployment runbook

This runbook is for the final Azure SRE Agent. The bootstrap has already created the agent,
its action identity, and the lab resource group, and has granted the action identity temporary
Owner on that resource group.

## Run the deployment

Use the workspace terminal to launch the repository-owned deployment script once:

```bash
bash labs/onboardinglab/scripts/deploy-agent.sh \
  <AGENT_IDENTITY_CLIENT_ID> \
  <SUBSCRIPTION> \
  <LAB_RG> \
  <LOCATION> \
  <NAME_PREFIX> \
  <AGENT_NAME> \
  <AGENT_IDENTITY_NAME>
```

Use the exact values from the deployment request. Do not invent or substitute values.

The first operation signs Azure CLI in with the existing user-assigned action identity:

```bash
az login --identity --client-id <AGENT_IDENTITY_CLIENT_ID>
```

The script then owns the full workflow:

- validates the identity, subscription, regional capabilities, tools, and disk space
- acquires both ARM and SRE Agent data-plane tokens
- deploys the Bicep-authored infrastructure from its compiled ARM artifact
- monitors Azure deployment state and reports progress
- packages and publishes the checkout application through asynchronous OneDeploy
- monitors the existing OneDeploy operation without submitting duplicate uploads
- generates and applies skills, knowledge, hooks, prompts, and tool policy
- verifies the agent, alert, application, checkout path, and telemetry
- writes the verified ARM completion marker used by external finalization

Keep the operator informed with the status lines emitted by the script. Do not duplicate its
individual commands in separate Azure CLI tool calls. If the terminal or thread is interrupted,
run the same script command again; it detects active or completed deployments and resumes safely.

If extended configuration fails with `settings/global: A single strong ETag is required for the
settings update`, do not run the external finalizer. Record the full error and have the shared
configuration template repaired so it handles an absent global-settings document before rerunning
the same deployment script. The run is incomplete until the script verifies checkout and telemetry
and writes its completion marker.

Do not install dependencies, create another SRE Agent or managed identity, enable the database
fault, modify resources outside `LAB_RG`, remove temporary Owner, or lower the agent's access.
The external bootstrap finalizer performs and verifies that final boundary.

When the script prints `External finalization is safe`, report:

- the checkout URL
- the full agent portal URL
- that workload deployment, configuration, checkout, and telemetry verification succeeded
- that the operator can now run `bootstrap-agent.ps1 -Finalize`
