# Break Bad Deploy: Ship a bad config rollout that regresses the product listing.
#
# Scenario 4 — Bad Deploy / Rollback (deployment-signal correlation).
#
# Set FAULT_INJECT=500 through `kubectl set env` to create a new rollout revision.
# The investigation can compare the 5xx onset with rollout history and KubeEvents,
# then restore the previous revision with `kubectl rollout undo`.
#
# Detection reuses the existing Zava-http-5xx-errors scheduled-query alert (it
# counts failed AppRequests over the window). No external load generator needed:
# the in-cluster 1 Hz self-probe already hits GET /api/products, so the
# failed-request count crosses the threshold on its own. The liveness AND readiness
# probes both hit /livez, and /api/health stays green, so only the product route
# regresses.
#
# AKS is a PRIVATE cluster — every K8s op runs through `az aks command invoke`
# (via Invoke-AksCommand), the same path the SRE Agent uses for remediation.
