# Deployment Compliance Monitoring with Azure SRE Agent

Automatically detect and respond to non-compliant Azure Container App deployments using SRE Agent, Activity Logs, and a custom compliance skill.

## The Problem

Teams deploy Container Apps through multiple channels — CI/CD pipelines, Azure Portal, Azure CLI, PowerShell. Without enforcement, ad-hoc Portal changes bypass code review, lack audit trails, and break infrastructure-as-code workflows. Manually auditing Activity Logs is tedious and reactive.

## The Solution

An SRE Agent skill that continuously monitors Activity Logs, classifies every Container App deployment by caller identity (`claims.appid`), and flags non-compliant changes. The agent can recommend — and with user approval — revert unauthorized deployments.

### How Compliance Detection Works

```
Container App deployment happens
          │
          ▼
Activity Log records the operation
  - Caller: who did it
  - claims.appid: which app/tool was used
          │
          ▼
SRE Agent queries AzureActivity table in LAW
          │
          ▼
Classify by claims.appid:
  ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │ c44b4083... = Azure Portal      → NON-COMPLIANT     │
  │ 04b07795... = Azure CLI          → NON-COMPLIANT     │
  │ 1950a258... = Azure PowerShell   → NON-COMPLIANT     │
  │ Caller has @  = User principal   → NON-COMPLIANT     │
  │ Other GUID    = Service Principal → COMPLIANT         │
  └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
          │
          ▼
Verify with resource tags (secondary signal):
  deployed-by=pipeline? commit-sha? pipeline-run-id?
          │
          ├── All compliant → Report clean scan
          │
          └── Non-compliant found:
                  │
                  ▼
              Generate report
              Recommend revert
              Activate approval hook
              Wait for user confirmation
                  │
                  ▼
              User approves → Revert to previous revision
```

## Setup

### Prerequisites

#### Required Tools

| Tool | macOS | Windows |
|------|-------|---------|
| [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) 2.60+ | `brew install azure-cli` | `winget install Microsoft.AzureCLI` |
| [Azure Developer CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/install-azd) 1.9+ | `brew install azd` | `winget install Microsoft.Azd` |
| [Git](https://git-scm.com/) 2.x | `brew install git` | `winget install Git.Git` (includes Git Bash) |
| [Python](https://python.org) 3.10+ | `brew install python3` | `winget install Python.Python.3.12` |
| [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/) 1.6+ | `brew install jq` | `winget install jqlang.jq` |

> **Windows note:** After installing Python, disable the Windows Store app aliases:
> **Settings → Apps → Advanced app settings → App execution aliases** → turn OFF `python.exe` and `python3.exe`

#### Check prerequisites

```bash
# macOS/Linux
bash scripts/prereqs.sh

# Windows (Git Bash or CMD)
"C:\Program Files\Git\bin\bash.exe" scripts/prereqs.sh
```

#### Azure Requirements

- Active Azure subscription
- **Contributor** role on the subscription
- GitHub account (for code repository and CI/CD pipeline)
- Register the resource provider:
  ```bash
  az provider register -n Microsoft.App --wait
  ```

### Step 1: Provision Infrastructure

#### macOS / Linux

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/dm-chelupati/compliancedemo.git
cd compliancedemo

# Sign in to Azure
az login
azd auth login

# Initialize and provision
azd init
azd provision
```

#### Windows

```cmd
REM Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/dm-chelupati/compliancedemo.git
cd compliancedemo

REM Sign in to Azure
az login
azd auth login

REM Initialize and provision
azd init
azd provision

REM If post-deploy fails with 'bash not found':
"C:\Program Files\Git\bin\bash.exe" scripts/post-deploy.sh
```

### Step 2: Configure SRE Agent

```bash
bash scripts/post-deploy.sh
```

This script (idempotent — safe to re-run):

1. Resolves deployed resource names from `azd` environment
2. Assigns SRE Agent Administrator role to current user
3. Creates Activity Log diagnostic settings → LAW
4. Grants agent identity Log Analytics Reader + Monitoring Contributor
5. Enables Azure Monitor as incident platform
6. Creates the compliance skill with org policy, KQL templates, tool references
7. Creates the approval hook (on-demand, blocks reverts without approval)
8. Creates response plan + scheduled task
9. Sets up GitHub OAuth connector and adds the code repository
10. **Verifies everything** — checks all connectors, resources, and tools

The script ends with a verification report:
```
  Connectors:
    ✓ LAW query access: Built-in (Log Analytics Reader + diagnostic settings)
    ✓ GitHub connector: Connected
  Code Repositories:
    ✓ compliancedemo: https://github.com/dm-chelupati/compliancedemo (sync: Ready)
  Incident Platform:
    ✓ Azure Monitor: Connected
  Agent Resources:
    ✓ Skill: deployment-compliance-check
    ✓ Hook: deployment-compliance-approval
    ✓ Response plan: containerapp-compliance
    ✓ Scheduled task: compliance-scan
  ✓ All 8/8 checks passed — agent is fully set up!
```

### Step 3: Authorize GitHub (one-time)

Open the OAuth URL printed by the script in your browser and click "Authorize."

### Verify Setup

After all steps complete, open your agent at [sre.azure.com](https://sre.azure.com) and click **Full setup**. You should see green checkmarks on:

| Card | Expected Status |
|------|----------------|
| **Code** | ✅ 1 repository |
| **Incidents** | ✅ Connected to Azure Monitor |
| **Azure resources** | ✅ 1 resource group added |
| **Knowledge files** | ✅ 1 file |

> **Checkpoint:** If any card is missing a checkmark, re-run the setup script: `bash scripts/post-deploy.sh`

Once verified, click **"Done and go to agent"** to open the agent chat and start the team onboarding conversation.

### Team Onboarding

The agent opens a **"Team onboarding"** thread automatically. It will:

1. **Explore your connected context** — reads the code repository, Azure resources, and knowledge files you connected during setup
2. **Interview you about your team** — ask about your team structure, on-call rotation, services you own, and escalation paths

Since the agent already has context from setup, try asking it questions:

> *"What do you know about the compliance demo architecture?"*
>
> *"Summarize the deployment compliance skill"*
>
> *"What Azure resources are in my resource group?"*

The agent saves your team information to persistent memory and references it in every future investigation.

> **Tip:** Ask *"What should I do next?"* for personalized recommendations based on what's connected.

## Demo Steps

### Demo 1: Verify Agent Can Query Activity Logs

Open the agent portal and ask:

```
Use the deployment-compliance-check skill to check deployment compliance
for the last 4 hours
```

The agent should:
- Read the skill to understand the org policy
- Query `AzureActivity` in the LAW using `QueryLogAnalyticsByResourceId`
- Classify any Container App deployments it finds
- Generate a compliance report

### Demo 2: Trigger a Non-Compliant Deployment (Portal)

1. Go to **Azure Portal** → Container Apps → `ca-api-compliancedemo`
2. Click **Revisions and replicas** → **Create new revision**
3. Change something (e.g., add an environment variable `TEST=1`) → **Create**
4. Wait 5-15 minutes for the Activity Log to reach LAW

Then ask the agent:

```
Check deployment compliance for the last 30 minutes
```

The agent should flag the Portal deployment as **non-compliant** (caller `claims.appid = c44b4083-3bb0-49c1-b47d-974e53cbdf3c`).

### Demo 3: Automated Alert Response

When the alert rule fires on the Portal deployment:
- Azure Monitor sends the alert to the SRE Agent
- The response plan triggers the compliance skill
- The agent investigates and classifies the deployment
- If non-compliant, it recommends a revert and activates the approval hook
- **You decide** whether to approve the revert

### Demo 4: Compliant Deployment (CI/CD)

```bash
cd /tmp/compliancedemo
echo "// compliance test" >> src/api/server.js
git add -A && git commit -m "Test compliant deployment" && git push
```

GitHub Actions builds and pushes the image to ACR. Deploy with:

```bash
bash scripts/deploy.sh
```

Then ask the agent to check compliance — this deployment should be classified as **compliant** (service principal caller + pipeline tags).

### Demo 5: Scheduled Compliance Scan

The `compliance-scan` task runs every 30 minutes automatically. Check recent results in the agent's thread history.

```

## Key Design Decisions

- **Built-in LAW access** — No ADX/Kusto connector needed. The agent queries Log Analytics natively via `QueryLogAnalyticsByResourceId` with Log Analytics Reader RBAC.
- **Activity Log diagnostic settings** — Stream Activity Logs to LAW so they're queryable via KQL.
- **`claims.appid` classification** — Well-known app IDs for Portal/CLI/PowerShell are Microsoft constants. More reliable than caller email parsing.
- **Dual-signal detection** — Caller identity (primary) + resource tags (secondary). Tags can be stale; caller identity is authoritative.
- **Approval hook** — Never auto-reverts. Always asks the user first via the `deployment-compliance-approval` hook.
- **Skill as single source of truth** — All compliance logic (policy, data sources, tools, KQL, classification rules, revert procedures) lives in the skill. Response plans and scheduled tasks just reference it.
- **Data plane API for connectors** — Uses the agent's data plane API (`/api/v2/extendedAgent/connectors/`) for connector management, not ARM (which doesn't reliably persist `dataSource`).
