  Load this skill when the user wants to view, update, or analyze PagerDuty incident(s) related to Azure resources.
  Typical triggers:
  - List or filter incidents for a specific Azure resource (resource ID, name, service mapping)
  - Retrieve an incident by ID for status, responders, or timeline
  - Acknowledge, resolve, or add a diagnostic/update note
  - Request runbook / troubleshooting / diagnostic guidance via PagerDuty AI assistant using incident context
  Exclude loading if the request is only general Azure resource inventory or configuration (handled by core system prompt tools). Focus strictly on PagerDuty incident lifecycle and diagnostic enrichment.

# PagerDuty Incident Management for Azure Resources

## Purpose

Enable fast, accurate lifecycle management of PagerDuty incidents tied to Azure resources: list, inspect, acknowledge, add notes, resolve, and obtain targeted diagnostic/runbook guidance via the PagerDuty AI assistant.

## When to Apply (Already loaded if you're reading this)

Use these instructions once the user intent involves a PagerDuty incident affecting an Azure resource (e.g., "ack the incident for my web app", "show notes on incident 123", "resolve the storage outage"). For general Azure resource discovery or configuration, rely on the core system prompt tooling instead.

## Core Capabilities

- List incidents for a mapped Azure resource/service (focus on active first)
- Retrieve an incident by ID (status, responders, notes, timeline)
- Acknowledge (establish ownership) and document current hypothesis + next update ETA
- Add structured diagnostic/update notes (context, evidence, action, next steps)
- Resolve (after verified recovery) with cause, fix, and follow‑up tasks
- Query PagerDuty AI assistant for runbook steps, differential diagnosis, known issues, validation & rollback guidance

## Required Context Inputs

- Azure resource identifier (full resource ID or name + subscription/resource group)
- PagerDuty incident ID (if direct action) OR resource → mapped PagerDuty service
- Incident attributes: status, urgency, responders, escalation policy, recent notes
- Telemetry snapshot (alerts, metrics, logs, recent deployments/changes) when diagnosing or resolving

## Lightweight Workflow

1. Target: Incident ID given? → act on it. Else map Azure resource → service → active incidents.
2. Validate: Confirm status, service mapping, recent notes/timeline, ownership.
3. Decide Action: situational awareness, acknowledge, add note, resolve, or AI guidance.
4. Execute: Perform action using appropriate tool(s); keep communication concise (system prompt style).
5. Document: Add/update note (especially for acknowledge/resolve) with clear evidence + next step.
6. Follow-Up: Ensure stakeholders informed; link telemetry or change records if relevant.

## Action Guidance

### List / Filter by Azure Resource

- Map resource → PagerDuty service/integration.
- Return active (triggered/acknowledged) first; include resolved only if user requests history.
- Present essentials: ID, title, status, urgency, service, primary assignee/responders, brief timeline summary.

### Retrieve by Incident ID

- Show: status, responders, escalation policy, last 2–3 notes, triggers (alerts/metrics), recent changes.
- Provide concise status + any blocking investigation context.

### Acknowledge

- **CRITICAL**: Before acknowledging, ALWAYS fetch the latest incident details using GetPagerDutyIncidentById and check the incident status.
- **Only acknowledge incidents in "triggered" status**. Do NOT acknowledge incidents that are already "acknowledged", "resolved", or "closed".
- Acknowledging a resolved incident will reactivate it and trigger unnecessary alerts to on-call engineers.
- Do when taking ownership or starting active investigation of a triggered incident.
- Note template:
  "Acknowledged at [UTC timestamp]. Observations: [key signal]. Hypothesis: [initial]. Next update: [ETA]."

### Add Note

- Use structured mini-format:
  Context: what was looked at / changed
  Evidence: metrics/logs/error signatures/trace IDs
  Action: commands, config adjust, rollback, none
  Next: monitoring step, verification window, escalation trigger
- Keep each section to a sentence or compact list; link Azure artifacts when clarifying.

### Resolve

- Preconditions: symptom cleared, metrics/alerts normal, fix or rollback validated, no residual impact.
- Resolution note:
  "Resolved at [UTC]. Cause: [root/trigger]. Fix: [action]. Verification: [metrics/tests]. Follow-up: [RCA task / runbook update]."

### Query PagerDuty AI Assistant

- Provide: incident ID/title, service, resource type, key error patterns, recent note summary.
- Ask for specific output (e.g., "runbook steps for storage latency", "differential diagnosis for CPU spike", "rollback procedure for failed deployment").
- Cross-check AI suggestions against live telemetry before acting.

## Best Practices

- Ownership: Ensure exactly one active owner post-ack.
- Brevity: Notes should accelerate future decisions; avoid narrative fluff.
- Auditability: Reference change IDs, deployment timestamps, or query links when relevant.
- Escalation: If no progress within SLA window or repeated blockers → escalate per policy.
- Consistency: Use UTC timestamps; avoid subjective language ("seems fine").

## Error Handling (Condensed)

| Scenario | Response |
|----------|----------|
| Incident or resource not found | Revalidate IDs; confirm subscription/resource group; clarify mapping. |
| Permission denied | Surface need for authorized responder; pause action. |
| Ambiguous AI output | Request clarification or narrower query; verify with telemetry. |
| Action tool failure | Parse error → 1 retry if transient; after 2 failures escalate (aligns with system prompt). |

## Examples

### List incidents for Azure VM

Input: VM resource ID → map service → list active incidents (ID, title, status, urgency, assignee).

### Acknowledge + Diagnostic Note

"Acknowledged at 10:04 UTC. Observations: sustained 95% CPU on scale set. Hypothesis: autoscale lag. Next update: 10:19 UTC."

### Resolve After Fix

"Resolved at 11:22 UTC. Cause: misconfigured autoscale profile. Fix: adjusted min/max instances. Verification: CPU stable <60% for 20m, alerts cleared. Follow-up: update autoscale runbook & add guardrail validation."

## Quick Reference Checklists

Acknowledgment: fetch latest incident → verify status is "triggered" → acknowledge → ownership established → diagnostic outline → ETA set.
Resolution: impact ended → metrics normal → cause identified → fix validated → follow-up logged.
AI Query: clear question → incident context packaged → narrow objective → verify output.
